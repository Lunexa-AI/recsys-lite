### Plan to Address Weaknesses While Staying Lightweight

Thanks for the feedback—it's great you're pushing for improvements! Your target audience (students/lecturers in low-resource settings) demands we keep things *ultra-light*: no new heavy deps (e.g., avoid Optuna for tuning, TensorBoard for viz), maintain <100MB install, ensure offline compatibility, and run on 2GB RAM/old CPUs. We'll build on existing NumPy/SciPy, add optional features (e.g., via extras), and focus 70% on education (e.g., explainable additions) vs 30% prod.

Based on rigorous analysis (code searches confirmed feasibility in `algo.py`/`tools.py`; comparisons to light libs like Surprise show we can match without bloat), here's what it would take to fix each weakness. Effort is estimated in dev days (assuming 4-6 hours/day). Total: ~10-14 days for all, done incrementally on branches. Prioritize education fixes first.

#### 1. **Limited Scope & Features (Current: 5/10 → Target: 8/10)**
   - **Fixes**:
     - **Add Implicit Feedback**: Implement basic ALS (Alternating Least Squares) in `algo.py` as a new method in `RecommenderSystem` (uses NumPy loops, no new deps). For education, add `--explain` to show iterations. (Effort: 2 days; lightweight, as ALS is matrix ops.)
     - **Advanced Models**: Add simple KNN (cosine similarity on factors) – pure NumPy, integrates with SVD output. Bias handling: Add global/user/item bias params to `fit()` (simple subtraction/addition). (Effort: 3 days.)
     - **Large Datasets**: Add chunked SVD (process in batches) for matrices >10k – uses SciPy's svds in loops. Not distributed, but handles up to 100k on 4GB RAM. (Effort: 2 days.)
   - **Lightweight Impact**: All NumPy-based; optional for users (e.g., flag in CLI). Students get more concepts to learn without overhead.
   - **Why Feasible**: Codebase is extensible (subclass RecommenderSystem); tests can cover.

#### 2. **Tooling Not Best-in-Class (Current: 7/10 → Target: 9/10)**
   - **Fixes**:
     - **Advanced Metrics**: Add diversity (e.g., intra-list similarity) and coverage (unique items recommended) to `tools.py` – simple NumPy set operations. (Effort: 1 day.)
     - **Improved CV**: Enhance `train_test_split_ratings` to support true k-folds (multiple masks) and stratified sampling (preserve rating distribution). Add error handling (e.g., min non-zeros check). (Effort: 1 day.)
     - **Robust Pipelines**: Add try/except and validation to `RecsysPipeline` (e.g., check shapes between steps). (Effort: 0.5 day.)
     - **Killer Features**:
       - Auto-tuning: Extend `grid_search_k` to support more params (e.g., bias yes/no) – no deps needed. (Effort: 1 day.)
       - Visualization: Add console-based utils (e.g., ASCII heatmaps for matrices) in `explain.py`; make Matplotlib optional for plots. No TensorBoard. (Effort: 1 day.)
       - Pre-trained Models: Bundle tiny pre-fitted models in package (as .npz files, <10KB) for instant teaching demos. Load via new `load_pretrained()`. (Effort: 1 day.)
   - **Lightweight Impact**: All zero-dep; optional imports for Matplotlib. Matches scikit-learn utility without their size.

#### 3. **Testing & Robustness (Current: 6/10 → Target: 9/10)**
   - **Fixes**:
     - **Expand Tests**: Add edge cases to `test_tools.py` (e.g., empty matrices, all-zero ratings, large k). Aim for 90% coverage with `make coverage`. (Effort: 1 day.)
     - **Error Handling**: Add checks/raises in all functions (e.g., grid_search: handle cv=1, empty test sets). Use try/except in pipelines for graceful failures. (Effort: 1 day.)
     - **Rushed Implementation**: Review/fix recent additions (e.g., ndcg edge cases where idcg=0). Run full `make ci`. (Effort: 0.5 day.)
   - **Lightweight Impact**: Just more code— no runtime cost.

#### 4. **Community & Polish (Current: 5/10 → Target: 8/10)**
   - **Fixes**:
     - **Sphinx Warnings**: Fix config (e.g., add `myst_parser` properly, suppress warnings) – already started. (Effort: 0.5 day.)
     - **Differentiation**: Add "Why This Over a Script?" section in README: Emphasize teaching tools, tooling, offline support. (Effort: 0.5 day.)
     - **Attract Contributors**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md with specific "good first issues" (e.g., add new toy dataset). Add GitHub templates for issues/PRs. (Effort: 1 day.)
   - **Lightweight Impact**: Pure docs—enhances appeal without code changes.

#### Overall Implementation Plan
- **Branch**: `feat/fix-weaknesses` (create via tool).
- **Order**: 1. Scope/features (core value). 2. Tooling. 3. Testing. 4. Polish.
- **Total Effort**: 10-14 days; do in phases with PRs (e.g., one for features, one for testing).
- **Risks**: Keep changes optional/modular to avoid bloat. Test on low-spec VM.
- **Post-Fix State**: 9/10 overall—truly "best lightweight recsys" for your niche.

#### Can You Announce Now?
Wait until after these fixes (especially scope/testing) for a stronger launch. Current state is "good starter," but fixing these makes it "must-use" for your audience. Announce a "beta" now to get early testers, then full launch post-fixes.

Ready to start? I'll create the branch and implement phase 1 if you say "go."
